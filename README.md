# ESOF-322-Final-Project
A Repository Containing all Recourses for ESOF 322 Final Project


## Project Proposal:
Introduction: 

Most quiz taking applications today lack charm and engaging
features. At Quiz Beast we aim to change this and provide a
great user experience when taking and creating quizzes. We 
intend to improve the quiz taking experience online through
this application.

Project Overview:

The goals for Quiz Beast are to allow users to create or 
take a quiz depending on their preference. After each 
quiz the user will be given a score and it will be logged
on a leaderboard/scoreboard. The question order will be 
randomized and there will be a small chance for a random 
question to be added. These features will make Quiz Beast 
a fun and engaging quiz application.  

Scope of Work:

This project has a large scope. We have three phases to
help us lay out the project and implement features in a
structured process. 

Phase 1:

Quiz Taking - The main functionality in phase one is to
be able to select a quiz to take. It should function as
a normal quiz with questions and answers. After the quiz
ends it takes you back to the quiz selection.

Phase 2:

Leaderboards - In phase 2 we plan to implement a scoring
feature that will allow you to see how many questions you 
got correct. This score will also be put on a leaderboard 
where you can try and beat that score. The name of the user
will be kept track with a three letter name. 

Phase 3:

Quiz Creation - In the final phase we would want to implement
a feature that would allow users to create their own quizzes.
This would take a lot of work and need a lot of precautions.
This is why this is in the final phase. 

Timeline:

The final deadline for our quiz application is December 12.
So far we have hit a couple of the  milestones that we laid
out. We have implemented quizzes with questions and answers,
that when finished takes you back to the main page.
